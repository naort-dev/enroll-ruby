  # This script is meant to disassociate a consumer role for a person who is meant
  # to only have a resident role at this point in time since coverall phase 2 has
  # not been released yet. This script will mark all the current enrollments associated
  # with the hbx_id of the person in question being passed in as an environment variable
  # as coverall as well as destroy the consumer role associated with this person (since
  # they never should have had a consumer role to begin with). There is a corresponding
  # action on the Glue side that will mark all of the asociated policies with the hbx enrollments
  # in EA as coverall as well. Neither script on the EA side nor on the Glue side should
  # result in any new events being fired or the triggering of the creation of any new
  # enrollments/policies or EDI flowing out. Their intent is to strictly clean-up the
  # data to represent what should have been always there.
