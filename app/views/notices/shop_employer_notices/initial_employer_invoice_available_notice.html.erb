            <strong>Make your first month’s premium payment online or by phone.</strong><br>Payments over the phone or online are required for your first payment, as they can be processed immediately and will ensure your coverage will not be delayed. Checks are not accepted for the first month of coverage as they cannot be processed in time for your group’s enrollments to be transmitted to your health insurance company.<br></br>
            <strong>To Make a Secure Online Payment</strong><br><%= Settings.site.short_name %> offers small businesses the option to make their premium payments online through secure electronic check payment. Use the link below and follow the instructions in <a href="https://dchealthlink.com/sites/default/files/v2/forms/Employers-Paying-Your-Premiums-Online.pdf">Employers Paying Your Premiums Online guide.</a> to make your premium payment online here: <a href='https://www.e-BillExpress.com/ebpp/DCHealthPay/'>https://www.e-BillExpress.com/ebpp/DCHealthPay.</a><br></br>
            <strong>To Make a Secure Electronic Check Payment by Phone</strong><br>Call <%= Settings.contact_center.phone_number%><br>Select your language (1 for English, 2 for Spanish, additional language options available)<br>Select option for Small Business Employer<br>Select option for Need to Make a Payment<br></br>
            Once this first premium payment is received, your enrollments will be transmitted to the insurance companies to complete processing and setup of your group and each employee’s enrollments. The insurance companies mail member ID cards to each enrolled employee’s home address on or around the coverage effective date.<br></br>
            Once your coverage takes effect, you will receive regular monthly invoices from <%= Settings.site.short_name %> through the mail that include each employee’s enrollment, their premium, and the employer/employee cost breakdown. The invoices will also be available electronically in the employer account. All premium payments will be made directly to <%= Settings.site.short_name %> either online, by phone, or by mail.
