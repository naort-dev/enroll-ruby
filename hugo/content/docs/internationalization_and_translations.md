# Enroll Implementation Steps and Examples 

## Using Translations in Views/Controllers


### I18n.t vs t() both are acceptable

There have been a couple of different translation methods used in Enroll but we are using the `I18n.t` method.

In your view you should use when there is no interpolation, you should use either the t or I18n.t method:

```
I18n.t('insured.interactive_identity_verifications.failed_validation.override')

```

If you want to perform a "lazy" lookup, such as if you only wanted to translate a single word and wanted to match the first translation associated with it, use the t method:

```
t('.override')
```

Here is an example with interpolation (I.E. you needed to pass a variable)
```
<h4 class="modal-title"><%= t('devise.login_history.admin.history_for_user', email: @user.email || @user.oim_id) %></h4>
```
The above would be included in the translation file like so:

```
"en.devise.login_history.admin.history_for_user" => "Login history for %{email}",
```


Here are some additional examples where internationalization should be implemented:


1) Select Tags:

```
<%= render "shared/organizations/entity_name_and_type_fields", f: f, entity_kinds: Organization::ENTITY_KINDS[0..3] %>
```

The above renders a list of "entity kinds", which should include their own translation.

2) Title Tags for Screen Reader:

Visually impaired users rely on screen readers to read a webpage, and they will have difficulty navigating if they don't speak the language the title tags are in:

```
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user hidden-md hidden-sm hidden-lg" title="Families"></span>
```

The text "Families" should be internationalized.

3) Conditional Logic returning strings:

```
<td><%= pp.user.present? ? "Yes" : "No" %></td>
```

"Yes" and "No" should be internationalized.

4) Text for links:

```
  <%= link_to('Add Office Location', new_office_location_path(:child_index => f.object.office_locations.length, :parent_object => f.object_name), remote: true, class: 'btn btn-default pull-left') %>
```

The text "Add Office Location" should be internationalized.

5) Placeholder text:

```
<%= text_field_tag :agency_search, nil, placeholder: 'Name/FEIN', class: 'form-control' %>
```

6) Data loading text:

```
<a href="#" onclick="return false;" class="btn btn-select search" data-loading-text="Loading...">
```


### t is safer, doesnâ€™t error

The "t" method *will not* raise an exception for missing translations. I18n.t will generate an exception unless a key of "default" is passed, like so:

```
I18n.t('users.sign_up.success', default: "Successful Sign Up")
```

### Deprecated l10n helper

In the past we have used own `l10n` helper. This will soon be *deprecated*  in order to better conform to Rails conventions:

```
module DryL10nHelper
  def l10n(translation_key, interpolated_keys = {})
    I18n.t(translation_key, interpolated_keys.merge(raise: true)).html_safe
  rescue I18n::MissingTranslationData
    translation_key.gsub(/\W+/, '').titleize
  end
end
```

If the `l10n` is invoked, it will look into the [translation model](https://github.com/dchbx/enroll/blob/master/app/models/translation.rb) to find a record matching the keys from the YML file added and then loaded.

## Translation locations

Translations are specified in the YML files in the [config/locales](https://github.com/dchbx/enroll/tree/master/config/locales) as well as the [db/seedfiles/translations](https://github.com/dchbx/enroll/tree/master/db/seedfiles/translations) directories.

### CCA vs DC

The translations seed uses the site key with the following logic to determine which translations seed to use:

```
site_key = if Rails.env.test?
             'dc'
           else
             BenefitSponsors::Site.all.first.site_key
           end
```

So, if the key is "cca", the translations will be pulled from `db/seedfiles/translations/en/cca`, and so on.

### config/locales vs db/seedfiles/translations

The folder `config/locales` contains _generic translations_ for the Enroll platform as a whole, or gem plugins. They are not intended to be changed on a *per client basis*.. The folder `db/seedfiles/translations/**` is intended to contain *client* specific translations, such as verbage needed by the client for specific requested features.

_Example:_

`config/locales/` should contain the Devise login text, which will be the same for every client:

```
en:
  devise:
    confirmations:
      confirmed: "Your email address has been successfully confirmed."
```

`db/seedfiles/translations/en/dc` should contain client specific language such as this:

```
:'en.insured.answer_for_broker' => "Brokers are licensed professionals with health insurance expertise and long-standing relationships with Small Business owners, Individuals and Families. Brokers help clients identify their options and make choices that are in their best interest and meet their needs and budget. In the District of Columbia, Brokers must have an active DC license in good standing, complete training on %{site_short_name}, and have contractual relationships with each carrier in %{site_short_name} for the market in which he/she intends to sell. There is no cost to use an insurance Broker.",

```

Since the above text 

## Translation Seeding Process

Translations are seeded into the database with the [following command](https://github.com/dchbx/enroll/blob/master/db/seedfiles/english_translations_seed.rb):
```
bundle exec rake 'seed:translations[db/seedfiles/english_translations_seed.rb
```
If youre adding/changing translations and something is being deployed, be sure to ask Devops to run the command post deploy for you.

Please note that that command will run a different set of translations according to the environment.

## I18n Tasks

Enroll uses the [I18n tasks gem](https://github.com/glebm/i18n-tasks) to help with keeping track of the translations. With the command `bundle exec i18n-tasks`, you can see the available commands:

```
 health                           is everything OK?
    missing                          show missing translations
    translate-missing                translate missing keys with Google Translate or DeepL Pro
    add-missing                      add missing keys to locale data
    find                             show where keys are used in the code
    unused                           show unused translations
    remove-unused                    remove unused keys
    check-consistent-interpolations  verify that all translations use correct interpolation variables
    eq-base                          show translations equal to base value
    normalize                        normalize translation data: sort and move to the right files
    check-normalized                 verify that all translation data is normalized
    mv                               rename/merge the keys in locale data that match the given pattern
    rm                               remove the keys in locale data that match the given pattern
    data                             show locale data
    data-merge                       merge locale data with trees
    data-write                       replace locale data with tree
    data-remove                      remove keys present in tree from data
    tree-translate                   Google Translate a tree to root locales
    tree-merge                       merge trees
    tree-filter                      filter tree by key pattern
    tree-mv                          rename/merge/remove the keys matching the given pattern
    tree-subtract                    tree A minus the keys in tree B
    tree-set-value                   set values of keys, optionally match a pattern
    tree-convert                     convert tree between formats
    config                           display i18n-tasks configuration
    gem-path                         show path to the gem
    irb                              start REPL session within i18n-tasks context
```

The gem contains the file _spec/i18n_spec.rb_ which contains specs to check for missing or unused translation keys, as well as inconsistent interpolations or files that need normalizing.
