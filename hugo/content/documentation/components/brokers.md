# SHOP Brokers
Brokers can apply on DCHealthLink.com to become a registered broker. Brokers can apply on DCHealthLink.com to become a registered broker. When brokers apply on DCHealthLink.com their application is reviewed by the DCHBX business team and is either approved or put into a pending status. When an application is pending, a notification is automatically generated to the broker with pre-populated check boxes identifying the outstanding criteria the broker must fulfill to become a registered broker.

All pending broker applications are checked periodically by internal marketplace staff through their portal and any fulfilled criteria are updated, triggering an updated notification to the applicant broker.

When brokers are approved they are sent a notice that gives them a unique link to their broker account. When brokers click the link to establish their login credentials, they land on the account that was pre-created for them based on the information in their application.

Once the broker establishes his or her login credentials, consumers are able to select the broker from their account and the broker is searchable by consumers on DCHealthLink.com.

Brokers are able to update their information – including email address, F-EIN, mailing address, phone number, and website through their own account.

Once the brokers update their information, the same information is updated in real time and displays accordingly when consumers search for the broker or existing clients view their broker’s information.

The Enroll Application provides a dashboard for brokers where they may access and manage client employers and their employees. A broker’s account allows the broker to see all of his or her small group and individual clients. The broker is able to access employer, employee, and individual accounts from the dashboard.

The broker dashboard also filters initial and renewing employers, showing their status, including eligibility status for open enrollment, and binder payment status. From their dashboard, Brokers may drill down into client employers and their employees, performing operations such as adding an employee to the roster, updating employer point-of-contact, or initiating a Qualifying Life Event for an employee.

Brokers are only able to see their client’s information after the client has assigned the broker within the client’s account.

# Quoting Tool

Brokers can create model draft plan years that illustrate different plan offering scenarios. While creating a draft plan year, the broker can change plan offering models (all plans from a metal level, all plans from a carrier, one plan) and contributions (percentages and reference plan selection) to see immediate updated cost modelling for employer aggregate monthly costs and reports of each employee’s monthly cost in the reference plan, lowest cost available plan, and highest cost available plan. The broker can create/modify these draft plan years directly within the employer’s account so that the employer can log in, review the draft plan year, and make modifications themselves, if they choose.

A Broker Quoting Tool is designed to work as an interactive ‘scratch pad’ on laptop and tablet computers, that helps brokers develop and customize benefit coverage optimal for prospective and renewing employers.

Starting with minimal roster information—employee counts and ages—the tool enables brokers to build out ‘what if’ scenarios with alternative coverage and contribution benefit packages, performing comparisons organized either by cost or benefit criteria.

When complete, these scenarios may be transmitted to the employer for review and selection. When selected by the employer, the scenario automatically generates the plan year application ready to submittal to the exchange.

In their accounts, brokers are provided a dashboard where they may track employer prospects and their quotes. The dashboard supports quote cloning, which provides convenience for creating templates for employer profiles, or generation of year-over-year quotes for current clients.
